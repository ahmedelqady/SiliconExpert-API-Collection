# HTML Block Contract

## Required Editable Blocks

The sync engine may edit only these HTML/JS blocks:

- `const API_DATA = { ... };`
- `const EXAMPLES = { ... };`
- Release notes section generated by `renderReleaseNotes()`.

## Safety Rules

- If any required block is missing, duplicated, or unparsable, sync fails.
- No fallback free-form string replacement outside defined blocks.
- Updated output must preserve valid JavaScript object syntax.

## Determinism Rules

- Stable key ordering for generated objects.
- Stable ordering for categories/endpoints/examples in output.
- No timestamp injection into content blocks except explicit release note metadata.
